# ADS-LZW-Project
This project is a comprehensive study of how a Lempel-Ziv (LZW) Compression Algorithm works on both an image (PNG and JPG) and a text file (TXT). It takes the target file name and extension present on the user's desktop and compresses it into a .lzw file.

## About Lempel-Ziv-Welch Algorithm
The Lempel-Ziv-Welch Algorithm, or LZW Algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm that is primarily used for images and works by reading a sequence of symbols and contactinating them into strings, and finally converting the strings into ASCII codes, before storing them inside a dictionary where the same sequences get stored inside the same key.
